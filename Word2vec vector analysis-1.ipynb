    "Many NLP packages support working with word embeddings. In this notebook you can work through the various problems assigned in Task 3. We've provided the basic functionality for loading word vectors using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html), a good library for learning and using word vectors, and for working with the vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fun parts of word vectors is getting a sense of what they learned. Feel free to explore the vectors here! "

Adding \"artist's\" seems to be a valid completion of the analogy, as it connects the idea of art with the idea of someone who creates it."
